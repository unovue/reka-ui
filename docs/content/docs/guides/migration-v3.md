# Migration - v2 to v3

<Description>
This guide collects the breaking changes between Reka UI v2 and v3, with search-and-replace instructions for each of them.
</Description>

Reka UI v3 is still in progress. This page collects the breaking changes as they land on the `v3` branch, so it will keep growing until the release is finalized. Each section describes what changed and the mechanical rewrite needed to move an existing v2 codebase over.

## `data-state` vocabulary

In v3, `data-state` answers exactly one of two questions: disclosure ("is this surface revealed?") is reported as `open` or `closed`, and selection ("is this control in its affirmative state?") is reported as `checked` or `unchecked`, with `indeterminate` reserved for tri-state controls that also emit `aria-checked="mixed"`. Both values are always emitted—`data-state` is never absent—and qualifiers such as *how* a surface came to be open live in their own `data-*` attribute rather than in `data-state`.

Parts that were already on `open` / `closed` or `checked` / `unchecked` / `indeterminate` are unchanged. Genuine multi-value machines keep their vocabulary: [Progress](../components/progress) (`indeterminate` / `loading` / `complete`), [Stepper](../components/stepper) (`completed` / `active` / `inactive`) and the [Splitter](../components/splitter) resize handle (`drag` / `hover` / `inactive`) are untouched.

| Part | v2 | v3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Toggle`, `ToggleGroupItem`, `ToolbarToggleItem` | `on` / `off` | `checked` / `unchecked` |
| `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` | `active` / `inactive` | `checked` / `unchecked` |
| `TagsInputItem`, `TagsInputItemDelete` | `active` / `inactive` | `checked` / `unchecked` |
| `RatingItemIndicator` | `active` / (absent) | `checked` / `unchecked` |
| `ScrollAreaScrollbar`, `ScrollAreaThumb`, `NavigationMenuIndicator` | `visible` / `hidden` | `open` / `closed` |
| `SplitterPanel` | `expanded` / `collapsed` / (absent when not collapsible) | `open` / `closed` (non-collapsible panels are always `open`) |
| `CollapsibleContent` | `open` / `closed` / (absent on the initial animated mount) | `open` / `closed` |
| `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent` | `closed` / `delayed-open` / `instant-open` | `open` / `closed`, plus a boolean `data-delayed` attribute present while open when the open was delayed |
| Everything already on `open` / `closed` or `checked` / `unchecked` / `indeterminate` | unchanged | unchanged |

### Search and replace

The rewrites are mechanical. In Tailwind variants:

- `data-[state=on]:` → `data-[state=checked]:`, `data-[state=off]:` → `data-[state=unchecked]:`
- `data-[state=active]:` → `data-[state=checked]:`, `data-[state=inactive]:` → `data-[state=unchecked]:` — for **Tabs and TagsInput only**. Stepper keeps `active` / `inactive` / `completed`, so leave selectors on `StepperItem` alone.
- `data-[state=visible]:` → `data-[state=open]:`, `data-[state=hidden]:` → `data-[state=closed]:`
- `data-[state=expanded]:` → `data-[state=open]:`, `data-[state=collapsed]:` → `data-[state=closed]:`
- `data-[state=delayed-open]:` → `data-[state=open]:data-[delayed]:`
- `data-[state=instant-open]:` → `data-[state=open]:` (combine with `:not([data-delayed])` in plain CSS if you need to target instant opens specifically)

In plain CSS the same rewrites apply to attribute selectors:

- `[data-state='on']` → `[data-state='checked']`, `[data-state='off']` → `[data-state='unchecked']`
- `[data-state='active']` → `[data-state='checked']`, `[data-state='inactive']` → `[data-state='unchecked']` — Tabs and TagsInput only, not Stepper.
- `[data-state='visible']` → `[data-state='open']`, `[data-state='hidden']` → `[data-state='closed']`
- `[data-state='expanded']` → `[data-state='open']`, `[data-state='collapsed']` → `[data-state='closed']`
- `[data-state='delayed-open']` → `[data-state='open'][data-delayed]`
- `[data-state='instant-open']` → `[data-state='open']:not([data-delayed])`

Because both values are now always emitted, any styles that relied on the attribute being *absent* (for example `.RatingItemIndicator:not([data-state])`, or a `SplitterPanel` without `data-state` because it is not collapsible) should target the explicit `unchecked` / `open` value instead.

```css
.Toggle[data-state='on'] { /* [!code --] */
.Toggle[data-state='checked'] { /* [!code ++] */
  background-color: var(--green-5);
}

.TabsTrigger[data-state='active'] { /* [!code --] */
.TabsTrigger[data-state='checked'] { /* [!code ++] */
  color: var(--grass-11);
}

.TooltipContent[data-state='delayed-open'][data-side='top'] { /* [!code --] */
.TooltipContent[data-state='open'][data-delayed][data-side='top'] { /* [!code ++] */
  animation-name: slideDownAndFade;
}
```
